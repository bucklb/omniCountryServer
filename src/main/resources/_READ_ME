Idea is to investigate a server that exposes a rest controller, but can use soap or rest server to do things

To demonstrate
- need to have soapCountryServer running (on 8080) and restCountryServer running (on 9090)

Server starts in "rest" mode (so can get Australia, Italy or Japan)

    http://localhost:8081/country?country=Australia

    or get as string which explicitly details the source
    http://localhost:8081/countryString?country=Australia

then put in to soap mode (where countries are United Kingdom, Spain, Poland) using Postman as it's a POST
(in a production environment I suspect that a CURL command would be needed, give or take authentication)
    http://localhost:8081/setMode?mode=soap

Can now get Poland, but not Australia
    http://localhost:8081/country?country=Poland
    http://localhost:8081/country?country=Australia


Main thrust is to get a few generic restful endpoints that can be tweaked as to where they look.  That said it is
possible to call the soap & rest options rather explicitly
    http://localhost:8081/soap?country=Poland
    http://localhost:8081/soapString?country=Poland
    http://localhost:8081/rest?country=Australia
    http://localhost:8081/restString?country=Australia



URGENTLY need to
    deal better with "not found" scenarios
    lock down the modes that can be set
