# omniCountryServer

A restful controller that will make soap or rest calls to other servers (and can be switched between them)

## Getting Started

mvn clean install

### Prerequistes

Have soapCountryServer running on 8080 so that omniCountryServer can use its wsdl to generate needed files.

When running it expects soapCountryServer on 8080 & restCountryServer on 9090
